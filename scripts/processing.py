# Run record_batch.py

# Step 2.
# Begin cleaning data by getting all of the new audio files:
# - text (as is, and camel case)
# - duration (see if dead/silent audio exists - seems to occur if the file is > 4 seconds in duration)
# Run get_durations.py to get your new-batch.json

# Step 3. 
# Iterate over each dirty audio recording that needs trimmed and specify the new duration


# Step 4.
